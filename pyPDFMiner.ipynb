Now, Vehicular traﬃc inbig cities is more causing a problem to human being. But this vehicular traﬃc canalso be utilized for Power generation by means of new technique called “POWERHUMP”. If it is placed in heavy traﬃc roads, the weight and kinetic energy of thevehicles can be used to produce mechanical power in shafts and this mechanicalpower is once again converted into ELECTRICAL ENERGY.Project Name : A Study On Global Economical Crisis –Impact On Indian Stock MarketsRole : I Am instrumental ininformation gathering, projectexecution, assessment and delivery.Team Size : 1Project Duration : 1 YearProject DetailStudied about ﬁnancial crisis and the origin of crisis going  currently in theﬁnancial market, sub-prime theory in the US market, to understand impact ofsub-prime on US and global market.\r",
